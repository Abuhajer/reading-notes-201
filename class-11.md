 Images 

Controlling the size and alignment of
your images using CSS keeps rules that
affect the presentation of your page in
the CSS and out of the HTML markup.

*  Controlling sizes of images in CSS 

* You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.

* Specifying image sizes helps
pages to load more smoothly
because the HTML and CSS
code will often load before the
images, and telling the browser
how much space to leave for an
image allows it to render the rest
of the page without waiting for
the image to download.

*  Aligning images using CSS 

* Rather than using the img
element's align attribute, web
page authors are increasingly
using the float property to align
images. There are two ways that
this is commonly achieved:

1. The float property is added
to the class that was created to
represent the size of the image

2. New classes are created with
names such as align-left or
align-right to align the images
to the left or right of the page.
These class names are used in
addition to classes that indicate
the size of the image.

*  Centering images using CSS 

* By default, images are inline
elements. This means that they
flow within the surrounding text.
In order to center an image, it
should be turned into a blocklevel
element using the display
property with a value of block.

* Once it has been made into a
block-level element, there are
two common ways in which you
can horizontally center an image:

1. On the containing element,
you can use the text-align
property with a value of center.

2. On the image itself, you can
use the use the margin property
and set the values of the left and
right margins to auto.

*  Background Images 

* The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box.



*  Repeating Images 

* The background-repeat
property can have four values:

1. repeat

The background image is
repeated both horizontally and
vertically (the default way it
is shown if the backgroundrepeat
property isn't used).

2. repeat-x

The image is repeated
horizontally only.

3. repeat-y

The image is repeated vertically
only.

4. no-repeat

The image is only shown once.


*  Background Position 

* When an image is not being
repeated, you can use the
background-position
property to specify where in the
browser window the background
image should be placed.


*  Image Rollovers and Sprites 

* Using CSS, it is possible to create
a link or button that changes to a
second style when a user moves
their mouse over it (known as a
 rollover ) and a third style when
they click on it.



*  CSS3: Gradients 

* CSS3 is going to introduce the
ability to specify a gradient for
the background of a box. The
gradient is created using the
background-image property
and, at the time of writing,
different browsers required a
different syntax.


*  Contrast of background images 

If you want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low contrast in order for the text to be legible.




 Practical Information 

*  Search Engine Optimization(SEO) 

* Search engine optimization (or
SEO) is the practice of trying
to help your site appear nearer
the top of search engine results
when people look for the topics
that your website covers.


 On-Page SEO 

In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords (the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order to improve its findability.

1. Page Title
The page title appears at the top
of the browser window or on the
tab of a browser. It is specified in
the `<title>` element which lives
inside the `<head>` element.

2. URL / Web Address

The name of the file is part of
the URL. Where possible, use
keywords in the file name.

3. Headings

If the keywords are in a heading
<hn> element then a search
engine will know that this page is
all about that subject and give it
greater weight than other text.

4. Text

Where possible, it helps to
repeat the keywords in the main
body of the text at least 2-3
times. Do not, however, over-use
these terms, because the text
must be easy for a human to
read.

5. Link Text

Use keywords in the text that
create links between pages
(rather than using generic
expressions such as "click here").

6. Image Alt Text

Search engines rely on you
providing accurate descriptions
of images in the alt text. This
will also help your images show
up in the results of image-based
searches.

7. Page Descriptions

The description also lives inside
the `<head>` element and is
specified using a `<meta>` tag.
It should be a sentence that
describes the content of the
page. (These are not shown in
the browser window but they
may be displayed in the results
pages of search engines.)

 How to Identify Keywords and Phrases 

Determining which keywords to use on your site can be one of the
hardest tasks when you start to think about SEO. Here are six steps that will help you identify the right keywords and phrases for your site.

1. Brainstorm

List down the words that
someone might type into
Google to find your site. Be sure
to include the various topics,
products or services your site is
about.

2. Organize

Group the keywords into
separate lists for the different
sections or categories of your
website.

3. Research

There are several tools that let
you enter your keywords and
then they will suggest additional
keywords you might like to
consider.

4. Compare

It is very unlikely that your
site will appear at the top of
the search results for every
keyword. This is especially true
for topics where there is a lot
of competition. The more sites
out there that have already been
optimized for a given keyword,
the harder it will be for you to
rise up the search results when
people search on that term.

5. Refine

Now you need to pick which
keywords you will focus on.
These should always be the ones
that are most relevant to each
section of your site.

6. MAP

Now that you have a refined list
of keywords, you know which
have the most competition, and
which ones are most relevant,
it is time to start picking which
keywords you will use for each
page.


## Analytics: Learning about your Visitors

As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by Google called Google Analytics.



##How Many People Are Coming to Your Site? 

The overview page gives you a snapshot of the key information you are likely to want to know. In particular, it tells you how many people are coming to your site.




## What Are Your Visitors Looking At? 

The content link on the left-hand side allows
you to learn more about what the visitors are
looking at when they come to your site.

## Where Are Your Visitors Coming From? 

 Domain Names & Hosting 
 Domain Names 
 Web Hosting 
 Hosted Services 


 ## FTP & Third Party Tools 

To transfer your code and images from your
computer to your hosting company, you use
something known as File Transfer Protocol.

##  Flash 

Flash is a very popular technology used
to add animations, video, and audio to
websites.

 ## How Flash Works 

Since the late 1990s, Flash has been a very
popular tool for creating animations, and later
for playing audio and video in websites.

##  Use of Flash 

Since 2005, a number of factors have meant
that fewer websites are written in Flash or even
use elements of Flash in their pages.
