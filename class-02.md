## About Css ?
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements, so its give some style to the elemnt to how will be look
and its contain two parts
1. selector
2. declaration

 declarations sit inside curly brackets and need two parts for make a change 
1. The Property we need to change
2. the value will changed too

we can use Css in three way
1. Inline: in the tag 
2. internal : in the same text of html file in head part
3. extrenal : in file by alone and connect it by out html file using link tag

You need to know there alot of selectors type like 
1. Universal Selector using *
2. Type Selector using tag name
3. Class Selector using  .classname
etc ..

so you need to know the best way to use css by using external ,because its easier to track and edit any time

## About JavaScript ..
in the first you need to know the script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
and each step called a statment

so in javascript you can add your comment to explain what your code does, its help !

oke lets now know what its **Variable** ?
its a place to store data temporarily to use it when you need

how we can Delcare variables ?
by using var keyword following by variables name that you want , make its meanable
and you can assign a value by  useing assignment operater.

you need to know there are datatype for variables like
 1. strings
 2. boolian
 3. numbers

 And there are rules for name the variables like  :
 1. must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or anunderscore (_)
 2. ame can contain letters,numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_).
 3. cannot use keywords or reserved words.
 4.  variables are case sensitive
 5. Use a name that describes the kind of information
 6. if the name its more than one word you can capital letter for the first letter of every word 

#### What is arrays!?
a special type of variable,it stores a list of values.
you can create an array using var keyword  like var color 
but when u assign the values u do like this
colors ['white', 'black', ' custom']; 
or u can use another way called **array constructor**
var colors= new Array('white ' ,'black','custom'); 
to accsess this values we need to accsess by using index like  colors [0] its mean "white" 

lets talk now about other things
1.  **Expression** ..
    1. expression that just assign a value
    2. expression that use 2 or more value to return a single value
2.  **operators**
    1. Mathematical operators
    2. String operator
    3. Comparison operators
    4. Logical operators

and the final part or this topcis its 
## Decision making 
so what is Decision making? 
its to choses way of 2 or many way depends on some conditions 

and there 2 components
1. an expession evaluted , which retuen a value
2. an conditional statement

 we talk about **Comparison operators** early so what are they ?
 1. is equal to (==)
 2. is not equal to (!=)
 3. strict equal to (===)
 4. strict equal to (!==)
 5. Greater than (>)
 6. Small than (>)
 7. Greater than or equal(>=)
 8. Smaller than or equal(<=)

 and now about **Logical operators**
 1. Logical And (&&)
 2. Logical Or (||)
 3. Logicak not (!)

 so after talking about condtion lets talk about **if statement**
its checks a condition if it true will excuted any code in if block

**If Else**
its just if its worng its excuted the else block and if true the if blocks code
