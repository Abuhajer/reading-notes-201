# More about Html and JavaScript

## lets go to Lists 
the lists in html had 2 main types : 
1. **Ordered list** : we use tag ol for start it then after it use li tag for create listed item (use number) .

2. **Unordered list** : we use tag ul for start it then after it use li tag for create listed item  (use bullets).

there another type called definition list use dl tag for start list then for every definition use dt tag and dd if there another word for same definition

## Nested lists ! 
the need sometime to make unorderd and ordered or mix of them or multi of list insde other so we use them inside onther and that called nested lists 


## Boxes ! , what about it 
CSS treats each HTML elemenst represented like a box , have an
1. dimensions
2. margins and padding
3. borders (color,style,width,image,radius)
4. display (inline,block..)
5. shadows

 you can play with this properties with css

----------------------------------------------
## Arrays ? what is that! 
the array is special type of variable,store list of value
and its like that to create 
**colors= ['white','black','custom'];** 
and you can go throw value by index that started from 0
like color [0] its the white value string and u can change the value in same way

Lets now go back to switch statement and loops 

### switch statement 
its an statemnt have value called switch value  and have a casses 
if this value match some case it will be excutied the code in it

### Loops 
there are 3 type of loops 
1. For Loop
2. While Loop
3. Do While loop

the job of loops its check an condtion and if its return true its excute the code then recheck again the condtion until its return false 

there are somthing called loop counter that make the update for condtion that checked while looping
